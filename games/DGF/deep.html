<h2>The GameObject Queue</h2>
<p>GameObjects are held in a dictionary but the game engine treats this as a Queue when its rending and checking collisions.<br>
    When the engine is rendering or checking collisions, it reads the stack as a set of tuples (key and val) but ignores the key.<br>
    The last object added will be rendered and checked for collisions last, meaing you can use this to control the Z allignment of an object.
</p>
<p>Add a game object into the stack like below</p>
<pre class="codeholder">CreateObject("Obj1", new GameObject(50, 540, 50, 50, "#FFFFFF", false));</pre>
<p>The format for this call is as follows 
    <pre class="codeholder">CreateObject({name: string}, {GameObject: Object});</pre><br>
The format for the gameobject creation is as follows 
<pre class="codeholder">new GameObject({X: int}, {Y: int}, {Height: int}, {Width: int}, {Hex color code: string}, {Collision enabled: bool});</pre></p>
<p>This adds the GameObject into the dictionary. You can access the object like below. This would move the object 10 pixels to the right.</p>
<pre class="codeholder">GameObjects["Obj1"].Position.locX += 10;</pre>
<h2>Input binding</h2>
<p>Input bindings on the keyboard can be created and deleted on the fly.<br>They are held in a dictionary with the keycode been the key and the value 
    been a tuple holding which object to work on and what function to call on that object.<br>If the object field is left empty then the engine will call
        the function as normal. Below is an example of both.
</p>
<pre class="codeholder">
// Add a keybind that calls a function from an object
addInputBind("KeyQ", "QPressed", "GameObjects['Obj1']");
// Add a keybind that just calls a function
addInputBind("KeyW", "WPressed", "");
</pre>
<p>The format for this is as follows 
<pre class="codeholder">
addInputBind({Key code: stirng}, {Function name: string}, {Object selector: string});
</pre>
To delete a binding use the code below
<pre class="codeholder">
removeInputBind("KeyQ");
</pre>
The format for this is as follows 
<pre class="codeholder">
removeInputBind({Key code: string});
</pre></p>
<h2>Updaters</h2>
<p>Updaters are objects that receive a call from the engine on a function every tick. You can create one using the below code.</p>
<pre class="codeholder">
class GameClass extends GameObject {
    Updater = true;

    OnUpdate(){
        this.Position.locX += 10;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>The code above would move the object 10 pixels right every tick. The function and the variable need to be set for this to function.</p>
<h2>Objects that render images</h2>
<p>The engine can render images, but the object must be set up to do this. See below code that can do this</p>
<pre class="codeholder">
&lt;!--HTML is required for this to work--&gt;
&lt;img src="exmaple.jpg" id="image"&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
class GameClass extends GameObject {
    image = document.getElementById("image");
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>The image must be already loaded when it tries to render it, otherwise it will render nothing. The image can be made invisible using CSS.</p>
